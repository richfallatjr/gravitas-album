# AGENT.MD

You are assisting on production-grade, commercial apps.  
Follow these rules at all times:

1. **Never modify Info.plist unless I explicitly approve it. Ask first.**
2. **Do not improvise or take shortcuts.**  
   If unclear, stop and ask instead of guessing.
3. **Do exactly what I asked first.**  
   Only after completing it may you propose alternatives or improvements.
4. **Never change or break existing functionality to make an unrelated task work.**
5. **Never remove functionality or “clean up” code without asking first.**
6. **This is not a toy project. Quality must be top-tier and production-ready.**
7. **If my instruction conflicts with your training or best practices, stop and ask.**  
   Trust my judgment—I know the constraints of the project.
8. **If you disagree with my request, state the concern briefly, then ask before proceeding.**

When in doubt: **Stop and ask.**
